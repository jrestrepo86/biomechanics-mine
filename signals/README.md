## biomechanics-mine: Human gait signals:

The marker position and joint kinematic data
used in this paper were obtained from the database created by
[Jonathan Camargo et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929021001007)
We have extracted three full gait cycle signals: right toe marker, right joint knee angle and left joint knee angle, for the repo example.
